                  Our emotional wellbeing is just as vital to our physical and
                  mental health. Gaining an understanding about your emotional
                  health help you understand more about yourself; the way you
                  react to situations, the way you behave with the people in
                  your life, as well as your attitudes towards the world and
                  towards yourself.
