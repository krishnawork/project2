            Confidentiality
          </div>
          <div>
            Confidentiality is an essential part of all counselling and
            psychotherapy. It underpins the client&#39;s sense of safety and
            trust and contributes to making the therapeutic relationship
            different from any other. The Therapy Practice holds all records
            securely and will ensure confidentiality in the treatment of any
            information held about its clients, All information recorded and
            held is solely for the purpose of maintaining effective therapeutic
            treatment. All information will be kept confidential unless the
            client and therapist agree to discuss something with a third party.
            Where appropriate a consent form will be used. The only reasons for
            breaking confidentiality would be if the therapist considered that
            your life was at risk, if another person&#39;s life was at risk or
            if the therapist was liable to civil or criminal court proceedings
            if the information was not disclosed. If at all possible this would
            be discussed beforehand.
