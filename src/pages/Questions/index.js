                      This is a test of imagination, one form of intelligence.
                      You are going to be presented with some pictures, one at a
                      time, and your task is to make up as dramatic a story as
                      you can for each. Tell what has happened in the past of
                      the picture, describe what's happening in the present and
                      what is going to happen in the future in this picture. You
                      also have to describe what the characters are feeling and
                      thinking. You can devote approximately 5 minutes per
                      story, but you can also take longer if desired.
