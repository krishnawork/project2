This term refers to those who struggle with the motor skills necessary to write thoughts on paper, spelling, and the thinking skills needed for vocabulary retrieval, clarity of thought, grammar, and memory.  Dyscalculia: This term refers to those who struggle with basic number sense and early number concepts as well as have difficulties with math calculations and math reasoning.</div>\n                        </Panel>\n                        <Panel header=\"What are some of the signs that my child may have a learning disability?\" key=\"5\" className=\"faq-collapse-custom-panel\">\n                            <div className=\"faqBody\">Common signs of a learning disability include;  Short attention span,  Poor memory,  Difficulty following directions,  Inability to discriminate between/among letters, numerals, or sounds,  Poor reading and/or writing ability,  Eye-hand coordination problems or being poorly coordinated,  Fine and gross motor skills  Difficulties with sequencing,  Disorganization and other sensory difficulties, such as being overtly sensitive to sounds, smells and textures,  Difficulty knowing the differencing between right and left,  Difficulties adjusting to change.</div>\n                        </Panel>\n                        <Panel header=\"How can remedial therapy help?\" key=\"6\" className=\"faq-collapse-custom-panel\">\n                            <div className=\"faqBody\">Although a learning disability is a life long condition and cannot be cured, there are strategies and therapies that can be implemented to help the individual.

Aptitude tests, depending on the number of areas being tested can take between one and three hours to complete. Intelligence and learning disability testing in total can take three to four hours, but may be spread over multiple days. This is because if the client taking the test is a child they are likely to become tired faster. Once fatigue sets in, and if they are made to continue the test, their results may be adversely affected.
